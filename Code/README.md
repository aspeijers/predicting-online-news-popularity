1) Balanced Classes RF.R - Code trying to oversample the under-represented classes in the dataset in order to better predict classes 3, 4 and 5. 

2) DCI & Weekday Final.R - Code used to generate the final DCI and Weekday features and return them. 

3) Final_submission_features_gen.R - Code used to generate xgb 49 and gbm50 features matrices. (xGboost features generation is in other code)

4) h2o_300.R - parameter tuning code 

5) h2o.R - Code for installation and initialization of h2o. 

6) Histograms.pdf - Exploratory Analysis. 

7) InteractionTermsAnova.R - code for generating the first order interaction terms.

8) XgBoost_Features.R - Code for generating just the xgboost top 3 features to combine with the other features to form xgb 49. 

9) randomForestordinality.R - Code for evaluating posterior probabilities by developing binary classification trees using randomForest.
